**Note: this mod is client side only and won't work on servers**

**Note: This is mainly for educational purposes to allow sysadmins to reverse a patch out of this for their own server.**

A Fabric mod that lets you dupe stuff.

Reversed from a mod by "andrew_10_" that has been floating around the interwebs.

## Explained
This is pretty much the age old trick of overloading a chunk with too much data so that it won't save.
In this case its book tags and subtags filled with random data and esoteric unicode characters.

## Usage

1. Put items you want to dupe in your inventory.
2. Log out to force save server side.
3. Log back in
4. Place items in chest
5. Hold book and quill
6. Type `kekdupe` in chat
7. Log back in
8. ??????
9. Profit
